ExpoPro is a Nuxt-based multi-tenant application that incorporates a robust back end. By design, it allows multiple clients to book multiple vendors, booths, and attendees for conventions and events. Its broad design allows for multiple conventions to be run at once, with everything from venue layouts to attendee participation being tracked.

## Database architecture

The site architecture incorporates a Tailwind CSS–based Nuxt front end and a ColdFusion-based backend using MsSql.
