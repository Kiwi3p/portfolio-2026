This is the project that started it all for me.

After years of entertainment industry experience administrating and building out post-production server hardware/software, our agency started getting requests for video advertisements in large-scale deliveries. This meant we needed animations, video edits, and exports to be done in several different markets at once.

At first, our small team could get these videos done, but as the ask turned into thousands of social media assets per quarter, we were overwhelmed.

After some initial brainstorming, I read up on scripting within the Adobe Creative Cloud. It was a clear solution. After some initial trials, I brought a script through that could switch out images and text based on spreadsheet data. From there, the project was brought to our London development team. They added conditionals that anticipated videos, animations, and re-formatting text based on language (e.g. Chinese vs. Latin characters).

Eventually we were able to automate 10,000+ social media ads to over 20+ language regions worldwide per quarter.

## Tech

This tech was more on the creative side. Dealing directly with process automation via scripting, the application would intake a Google Sheet handed to us by our clients. Based on a series of switch cases and conditionals, the application would filter through the cells of the sheet one by one. It would then read through our After Effects file and animation templates, switching out text, dimensions, assets (images, video, animation), and other features. Hours of busy work could be completed in a matter of seconds.
